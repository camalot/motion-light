This is a light I created to put in my pantry. The goal was to have a light that would turn on when you go in the pantry, and off when you leave.

- Light turns on when motion detected from the PIR Sensor and will stay on for 2 minutes. This timer resets with every motion detection
- Ligth turns on when someone asks Alexa to turn on the device. Will stay on for 5 minutes.
